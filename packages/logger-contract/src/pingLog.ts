/**
 * Exercise all logger levels to verify the communication channel is working.
 *
 * This is primarily used by extension tests to confirm that the core library's
 * logger is properly bound to the extension's output channel. When called, it
 * emits test messages at all four log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).
 *
 * The extension can observe its outputChannel to verify all messages are received,
 * confirming the core → outputChannel binding is functioning correctly.
 *
 * **Design Note:** This is a standalone function (not a Logger method) to keep
 * the Logger interface clean and avoid feature coupling. It simply exercises
 * the existing Logger interface without adding new methods.
